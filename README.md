A bash and vim setup that suits me. Feel free to fork if you like.

###### VIM
* Set colorscheme
* Pathogen plugin, takes care of loading other plugins
* NERDTree plugin, a great file manager while working in vim
* Added custom mappings
** `<C-g>` toggles NERDTree
** `<C-hjkl>` will move between the various windows in vim

###### Bash
* Numerous aliases to make managing ths sytem easier
* A few custom functions
